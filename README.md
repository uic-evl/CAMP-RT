# CAMP-RT
Correlations Across Multiple Patients in Radiation Therapy

## Motivation
Radiation therapy is one of the most common treatments for cancer, using high-energy radiation that can kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. However, the radiation can also damage normal cells, leading to side effects:

  - Dry mouth
  - Mouth and gum sores
  - Difficulty Swallowing
  - Stiffness in the jaw
  - Nausea
  - Tooth decay
  - Increased risk of stroke
  - Peripheral neuropathy
  - etc.

OARs (Organs at Risk): Healthy organs located in the radiation field during radiation therapy.

## GOAL
To provide an automated method to compute the similarities between multiple cancer patients and rank them accordingly. This would allow radiologists to optimize the radiation therapy plan in a short timeframe, while minimizing pain and side effects to healthy organs at risk.
